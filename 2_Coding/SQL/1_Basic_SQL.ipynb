    "1. CREATE TABLE is a statement that creates a new table in a database. (e.g. pd.DataFrame)\n",
    "2. DROP TABLE is a statement that removes a table in a database. (e.g. df.drop() (not exact match))\n",
    "3. SELECT allows you to read data and display it. This is called a query. indicates which column(s) you want to be given the data for. (e.g. df.loc[]). <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "#### CLAUSES: \n",
    "- SELECT *\n",
    "1. **AS** derived column <br> _,-,*,/<br> e.g. SELECT id, (standard_amt_usd/total_amt_usd)*100 AS std_percent, total_amt_usd\n",
    "1. **FROM** specifies from which table(s) you want to select the columns. Notice the columns need to exist in this table.\n",
    "2. **WHERE** <br> for numeric: >, <, >=, <=, =, != <br> for non-numeric w/ quote: =, !=, LIKE, NOT, or IN <br> use before order by.\n",
    "3. **ORDER BY** sort. default sort by accending, use ORDER BY <Column name> DESC for descending order <br>\n",
    "always comes in a query after the SELECT and FROM statements, but before the LIMIT statement. <br> can order by multiple columns at once.\n",
    "4. **LIMIT** sort data. very last part of a query. e.g. SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 10;\n",

    "#### Logical Operators: \n",
    "primarily used in **WHERE** <br>\n",
    "1. **LIKE** This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for cases when you might not know exactly what you are looking for. <br>\n",
    "    wild card '%google%'. **%** character or any number of character.\n",
    "2. **IN** This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for more than one condition.<br>\n",
    "    WHERE account_id IN (1001, 1021); WHERE name in ('Walmart', 'Target', 'Nordstrom')\n",
    "3. **NOT** This is used with **IN** and **LIKE** to select all of the rows **NOT LIKE** or **NOT IN** a certain condition. <br>\n",
    "    WHERE account_id NOT IN (1001, 1021); NOT LIKE '%google%'\n",
    "4. **AND & BETWEEN** These allow you to combine operations where all combined conditions must be true. <br>\n",
    "    examples:<br>\n",
    "    WHERE column BETWEEN 6 AND 10 <br>\n",
    "    occurred_at BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'<br>\n",
    "5. **OR** This allows you to combine operations where at least one of the combined conditions must be true.\n",
    "    examples:<br>\n",
    "    SELECT *<br>\n",
    "        FROM accounts<br>\n",
