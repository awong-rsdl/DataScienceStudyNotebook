    "#### Database Normalization\n",
    "There are essentially three ideas that are aimed at database normalization:\n",
    "1. Are the tables storing logical groupings of the data?\n",
    "2. Can I make changes in a single location, rather than in many tables for the same information?\n",
    "3. Can I access and manipulate data quickly and efficiently?<br>\n",
    "To learn more, read [SQL by Design](https://www.itprotoday.com/sql-server/sql-design-why-you-need-database-normalization)\n",
